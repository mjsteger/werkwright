* A set up for emacs that just works right!

Naming comes from combing old english words for ways to describe a toolmaker, and deciding that cobbling together werk(German for work) and wright(Proto-Germanic -> Old English for maker/builder) was a great way to describe emacs, since it's both a workmaker and it allows creating tools

Steals a lot from Prelude in overall structure, and lots of other stealing everywhere else

To install: symlink early-init.el like `ln -s ~/path/to/werkwright/early-init.el ~/.emacs.d/earlyish-init.el`, and then copy early-loader.el into e.g. ~/.emacs.d/early-init.el
